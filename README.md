# Rapid prototyping for the web using the U.S. Web Design System

At [Bixal](https://www.bixal.com/), we believe fast cycles of prototyping and testing accelerate learning, reduce risk, and improve outcomes. We started a dedicated internal team to explore new processes and tools for using web-based prototyping to help our delivery teams lower the barriers to making ideas more tangible more quickly.

If you're here, you'll probably be joining our event where we, the Rapid Response team, will be presenting who we are and what we're all about. 

We'll take you through a case study on how we improved the HHS OCR complaint portal assistant and then we'll walk you step-by-step on how to use our template to create your own complaint form screener. 

## What to do before the event

These suggestions are all optional, but if you're interested, you may get more out of time together if you do these things ahead of time:
- Read a [summary](https://github.com/Bixal/rapid-response-team/wiki/Project-story-%E2%80%94-USWDS-Screener-Prototyping-Tool) of the project we'll be covering.
- Poke around the [live site](https://bixal.github.io/uswds-screener-prototyping-tool/) to see how it works.
- Read the [readme](https://github.com/Bixal/uswds-screener-prototyping-tool#readme) of the GitHub project.
- Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- Try following the [instructions](https://github.com/Bixal/uswds-screener-prototyping-tool#how-to) in the readme for using our project as a template for your own project. And bring any questions or issues you run into!

## Background

### Why we’re here

At [Bixal](https://www.bixal.com/), we believe fast cycles of prototyping and testing accelerate learning, reduce risk, and improve outcomes. We started a dedicated internal team to explore new processes and tools for using web-based prototyping to help our delivery teams lower the barriers to making ideas more tangible more quickly.

### Why it’s relevant

As part of the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/), government agencies are required to modernize their websites using the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) to improve the public's customer experience. Our team is working to empower designers to take ownership of prototyping in the web medium and enable them to better collaborate with developers through the common language of the USWDS.

### Our objectives

- Consult our federal partners
- Support the growth of our business and practices
- Contribute to the community

### Principles

- Speed: With more making and less meetings, we decrease time to tangibility.
- Tangibility: By making prototypes, not promises, we increase our time to alignment.
- Reusability: With a focus on frameworks, we can make everything we do faster.
- Openness: By sharing our work, we can benefit from and contribute to the community.

### What we do

- Rapid prototyping
- Lean research
- Content and data repositories
- Template frameworks
- Facilitation

## Case study: HHS Complaint Form Screener

### Overview

A typical need we see in government is for people to fill out a simple screener before they complete a larger task. When these screeners are long, onerous, and confusing, they lead to wasted time and bad data.

Drawing inspiration from one of our HHS projects, we decided to build an accessible, plain-language, effortless template to allow for rapid iteration of a screener, before starting on any production code.

After making and testing 3 versions in less than 4 weeks, we demonstrated major improvements in user experience, accessibility, and usability that laid the groundwork for a better product.

### Problem statement

*How might we get people to the complaint form as soon as possible with the least amount of confusion?*

### Process

1. Test the current screener.
2. Brainstorm ideas in Figma using USWDS components.
3. Build new screener using USWDS, Jekyll, and GitHub Pages.
4. Conduct user testing and consider feedback.
5. Repeat Steps 2-4 as necessary.

### Scope

- Custom questions: Set up any number of questions with their own answer text, related resources, and pathing based on responses. (Radio buttons only for now.)
- Simple logic flow: For each answer, direct people to the next question, an exit page, or jump ahead to the success page.
- Linked resources: Each question and exit page can include resource content stored in its own plain- text pages.
- Step indicator: Show people where they are in the process, even if you're not building the whole thing.
- U.S. Web Design System: Built on USWDS for the best in accessible, responsive, usable web experiences for government-focused sites.

## Template Workshop

Now you try! For this part of the event, we'll walk you through how to reuse our template for your own screener applications. All you need is a GitHub account to make a copy and swap out content — no coding required.

### Steps

Here are the tasks we'll try together:

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) or log in.
2. Make a copy of our [repository](https://github.com/Bixal/uswds-screener-prototyping-tool).
3. Publish the site using GitHub Pages.
4. Configure a few site settings.
5. Edit question content.
6. Change homepage image.

### What to try next

Here are some other things you can do once you get the hang of it:

- Add new questions.
- Edit home, exit, or success page content using markdown.
- Advanced: Change the styling of [layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/) using [USWDS utility classes](https://designsystem.digital.gov/utilities/).
